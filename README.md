The Matrix

The matrix is about a future in which humanity is unknowingly trapped inside a simulated reality that intelligent machines have created to distract humans while using their bodies as an energy source. 

When a computer programmer Thomas Anderson, also known as "Neo", uncovers the truth, he joins a rebellion against the machines along with other people who have been freed from the Matrix. 

You will be playing as Neo and have to make a lot of hard decisions and maybe even sacrifice yourself for the greater good,  and the freedom of the people of Zion and the elimination of the machines and their creators. 

In different levels of the game you will get to know more about the other characters as you experience this action and mystery based game! After Neo realizes that he's living in a simulation and being controlled by machines and people are being used to generate energy at some point, he has to make a difficult choice between living his life in the simulation and pretend that nothing has changed, or to join a team of rebels and try to alter the fate of humanity. 

Through each level you will have different choices that will affect the way the game ends, so choose wisely!!

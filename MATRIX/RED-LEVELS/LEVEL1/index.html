            In the mid 21st century, AI have managed to defeat the original people, and ruin the real world; the machines began creating people, at the end of that time, human beings are no longer born, they were grown. the machines started plugging us into the Matrix, which is a neural-interactive simulation, that is created by the Architect, the creator of the machines, but the Architect created a gap, a solution to end the war between machines and the people, and the solution was the ONE, he is the one who will bring peace to the people of zion, because since then, the original people kept hiding from the Machines, hoping for a saviour.
